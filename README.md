## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

Resurrection Bay Coffee was built using semantic HTML and responsive CSS. The site is built for smaller screens, then CSS media queries were added to create a desktop-friendly layout. Limiting the number of images keeps the lightweight and fast to respond, while responsive CSS means the site looks good and works well across a variety of screen sizes.

## Optimizations

- rebuilt site as mobile-first to fix mobile user experience issues

## Lessons Learned:

The original version of the site included multiple background images; while this gave a little "wow" to the overall site design, it also made the site slower to load, made creating a responsive layout more challenging, and required the use of <div> tags for each section (which made the site potentially less accessible than a site built with semantic HTML tags). While some <div> tags remain, they are used for decorative aspects of the site, rather than to deploy needed content.
